Overview
========

In this project you will build a map/reduce job on Apache Spark. Your job will take a web site access log as input and as output produce data that can be used by a recommendation system.

Co-views
--------

One type of recommendation that a website may wish to produce is something like "People who looked at this also looked at ... ". That is, for every item on your site you would like to be able to produce a list of other items that people also browsed. These are sometimes called co-viewed items. The idea being that if a user looks at two different items they're probably similar in some important way so they should be associated with each other. Then in the future, when another user looks at one of those items the website can recommend they look at the other item as well.

Conceptually computing co-viewed items is straightforward: look at all the items that a user clicks on and put them all into the same co-view set. However, this has two problems. First, an item that a user looks at today probably shouldn't be considered a co-view of an item a user looks at tomorrow -- the user may be looking for very different things tomorrow so the co-viewed items wouldn't necesarily be similar. We should only associate two items as co-views if they happen in relatively quick succession and as part of the same search session. The second problem is that some users might randomly click on completely unrelated things in quick succession. We should therefore only associate two items as co-views if a critical mass of different people all click on the same pair of items.

In our project we'll ignore the first problem (clicks in quick succession) but we will address the second problem (critical mass of different people co-clicking).

A pseudocode map-reduce style algorithm for computing co-views is something like:

  1. Read data in as pairs of (user_id, item_id clicked on by the user)
  2. Group data into (user_id, list of item ids they clicked on)
  3. Transform into (user_id, (item1, item2) where item1 and item2 are pairs of items the user clicked on
  4. Transform into ((item1, item2), list of user1, user2 etc) where users are all the ones who co-clicked (item1, item2)
  5. Transform into ((item1, item2), count of distinct users who co-clicked (item1, item2)
  6. Filter out any results where less than 3 users co-clicked the same pair of items

Implementation
==============

Spark setup
-----------

Here is a Docker compose example for a two node spark cluster (one master and one worker node):
```
spark-master:
  image: gettyimages/spark
  command: bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master -h spark-master
  container_name: spark-master
  hostname: spark-master
  environment:
    MASTER: spark://spark-master:7077
    SPARK_CONF_DIR: /conf
  expose:
    - 7001
    - 7002
    - 7003
    - 7004
    - 7005
    - 7006
    - 7077
    - 6066
  ports:
    - 4040:4040
    - 6066:6066
    - 7077:7077
    - 8080:8080
  volumes:
    - ./data:/tmp/data

spark-worker:
  image: gettyimages/spark
  command: bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://spark-master:7077
  container_name: spark-worker
  hostname: spark-worker
  environment:
    SPARK_CONF_DIR: /conf
    SPARK_WORKER_CORES: 2
    SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY: 512m
    SPARK_WORKER_PORT: 8881
    SPARK_WORKER_WEBUI_PORT: 8081
  links:
    - spark-master
  expose:
    - 7012
    - 7013
    - 7014
    - 7015
    - 7016
    - 8881
  ports:
    - 8081:8081
  volumes:
    - ./data:/tmp/data
```

Here's a sample Spark program. It will read in a file consisting of two values -- a user id and a page id. The program will then calculate the frequency of each page id. 

```
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext("spark://spark-master:7077", "PopularItems")

data = sc.textFile("/tmp/data/access.log", 2)     # each worker loads a piece of the data file

pairs = data.map(lambda line: line.split("\t"))   # tell each worker to split each line of its partition
pages = pairs.map(lambda pair: (pair[1], 1))      # re-layout the data to ignore the user id
count = pages.reduceByKey(lambda x,y: x+y)        # shuffle the data so that each key is only on one worker
                                                  # and then reduce all the values by adding them together

output = count.collect()                          # bring the data back to the master node so we can print it out
for page_id, count in output:
    print ("page_id %s count %d" % (page_id, count))
print ("Popular items done")

sc.stop()
```

which reads a file like this of tab separated values:
```
tp      4
bob     5
tp      4
hank    3
```

The Pyspark program and it's data file will need to be present in the Spark containers. This is accomplished by using Docker volumes to make a data directory under wherever you run ```docker-compose up```. Put these files in that directory and then spark-master will be able to access your Pyspark program and spark-worker will be able to access the data file.

Submit and run your Pyspark job to your Spark cluster like this:
```
docker exec -it spark-master bin/spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 --total-executor-cores 2 --executor-memory 512m /tmp/data/hello.py
```

When you run your Spark program, Spark will generate A LOT of logging output. You'll have to look carefully for your program's output in the middle of it all. Also, if something goes wrong there may be many stack traces -- look for the first one to get an idea of what went wrong.

If all works then somewhere in the midst of all the Spark logging you'll see the output pages and their counts. Congratulations! You've run your first Spark job.

Take a moment and consider what has just happened. Spark distributed your program across however many workers were available, ran the map command, then shuffled the data for the reduce, and collected the results for you to see. While it was a lot of overhead to count four lines in a text file, this same program would have worked on a 1,000 node cluster processing a terrabyte of text files.

Spark Programming
-----------------
Spark calls the data objects it manipulates RDDs. The first RDD in the sample program above is created by the call to sc.textFile. Each RDD is actually partitioned across the workers in your Spark cluster. However, when programming you just reference the RDD as a single object. Spark handles the distributed computing behind the scenes.

RDD's support map/reduce style operations like we've discussed in class. For example, in the sample program the line
```
pairs = data.map(lambda line: line.split("\t"))
```
applies a map operation to the ```data``` RDD to produce a new RDD called ```pairs```. Every row of text in ```data``` is transformed into a row containing a Python pair/tuple in ```pairs```. The next line
```
pages = pairs.map(lambda pair: (pair[1], 1))
```
applies a map operation to each row in ```pairs``` to produce a new RDD called ```pages``` where each row is a pair of page id and the number 1. Finally, the line
```
count = pages.reduceByKey(lambda x,y: x+y)
```
does a reduce operation. This groups all the rows with the same key onto the same worker and then reduces all the values for those keys by summing.

Spark supports some other useful opreations on RDDs:

  1. groupByKey() - take all rows of the form (K,V) and group them into a single row of form (K, list of different Vs)
  2. distinct() - filter out all duplicate rows in an RDD to produce a new RDD with distinct rows
  3. flatMap() - like map, but returns multiple rows for when you want produce a new RDD with multiple output rows for each input row
  4. filter() - remove certain rows from an RDD
  
The Spark programming guide at http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#basics is a good reference.

Debugging Spark Programs
------------------------

Debugging Spark programs is somewhat more difficult for two reasons:

  1. Your code is running across multiple containers so if you print something it will go to the stdout of whatever container it is running in. This makes it hard to find and piece together.
  2. Spark logs a ton of debug info on it's own so your output can get lost along the way.
  
I highly recommend that you write and debug your program by printing each RDD after every step. The sample program shows how to print an RDD:
```
output = count.collect()                          # bring the data back to the master node so we can print it out
for page_id, count in output:
    print ("page_id %s count %d" % (page_id, count))
print ("Popular items done")
```

The ```collect``` call is what's important -- it collects all the data from the RDD it is called on and brings it back to the spark master. So then when the subsequent print operations run on it you know that you have all the data and that the output is appearing on the spark-master's stdout where you should see it in the terminal that you ran ```bin/spark-submit``` command.

It is also very useful to write comments for each line describing what the format of the RDD is. Since these RDDs are pairs, I always write down what the first and second value in the pair is to help me keep track.

If you have an error in your program, Spark will print an exception (or many exceptions). You'll have to read carefully through the logging output to find a reference to what line or part of your program actually failed.

What to turn in
================

You should turn in three things:

  1. Your source code in github
  2. Sample input file that your program takes as input
  3. Sample output produced by your program
